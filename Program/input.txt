The sky is blue\nRoses are red\nGrass is green\nThe sun is bright yellow\nThe ocean is deep blue\nThe clouds are white\nOranges are orange\nBlack is the color of the night\nThe fire is bright red\nThe leaves turn golden in autumn\nI love the purple flowers in spring\nThe walls of the house are painted pink\nA rainbow has many colors\nThe sand on the beach is golden\nThe apples are shiny green\nThe sunflowers are bright yellow\nMy favorite color is turquoise\nThe car is painted silver\nThe chocolate cake has a dark brown layer\nThe cats have black and white fur\nThe fish in the tank are colorful\nThe dress is a beautiful shade of teal\nThe chairs are bright red\nThe jacket is navy blue\nThe books have colorful covers\nThe sunset is a mix of orange and pink\nThe grapes are dark purple\nThe butterflies have vibrant colors
